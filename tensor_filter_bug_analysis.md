## File-by-File Bug Analysis

### ext/nnstreamer/tensor_filter/tensor_filter_nnfw.c

**Bug #1: Memory Leak in Custom Option Parsing**
- **Location**: Lines 153-175 in `nnfw_parse_custom_option()`
- **Issue**: When parsing custom options, the allocated `option` array from `g_strsplit()` is freed, but if the accelerator is set multiple times in options, previous `pdata->accelerator` values leak
- **Risk**: Memory leak on repeated property setting
- **Fix**: Free existing `pdata->accelerator` before reassigning

**Bug #2: Potential Double-Free in Error Path**
- **Location**: Lines 255-270 in `nnfw_open()` error_exit
- **Issue**: The `nnfw_close()` function is called on error, but `nnfw_close()` checks and frees `pdata->accelerator` without nullifying pointers properly
- **Risk**: Use-after-free or double-free
- **Fix**: Ensure proper null pointer checks and nullification after freeing

**Bug #3: Missing Null Check in Tensor Info**
- **Location**: Lines 460-470 in `nnfw_tensor_info_set()`
- **Issue**: `gst_tensors_info_get_nth_info()` can return NULL but this is not checked before dereferencing
- **Risk**: Null pointer dereference
- **Fix**: Add null check after getting tensor info

### ext/nnstreamer/tensor_filter/tensor_filter_tensorflow_lite.cc

**Bug #4: Memory Management Issue in XNNPACK Delegate**
- **Location**: Lines 380-400 in `TFLiteInterpreter::invoke()`
- **Issue**: When XNNPACK delegate is used, memory is copied but if `memcpy()` fails or tensor sizes are mismatched, no cleanup is performed for partially processed tensors
- **Risk**: Memory corruption or inconsistent state
- **Fix**: Add proper validation before memcpy operations

**Bug #5: Potential Memory Leak in Model Loading**
- **Location**: Lines 540-580 in `TFLiteInterpreter::loadModel()`
- **Issue**: If delegate creation succeeds but `interpreter->ModifyGraphWithDelegate()` fails, the delegate memory is not properly freed
- **Risk**: Memory leak of delegate resources
- **Fix**: Use RAII or ensure cleanup in error paths

**Bug #6: Race Condition in Shared Model Management**
- **Location**: Lines 980-1020 in `TFLiteCore::checkSharedInterpreter()`
- **Issue**: The shared model table operations use a global lock, but the interpreter pointer could be accessed after lock release and before usage
- **Risk**: Use-after-free in multi-threaded scenarios
- **Fix**: Extend lock scope or use reference counting

**Bug #7: Buffer Overflow Risk in Tensor Dimension Setting**
- **Location**: Lines 820-850 in `TFLiteInterpreter::setInputTensorsInfo()`
- **Issue**: When setting tensor dimensions, `tensor_info->dimension[rank - idx - 1]` access could go out of bounds if rank calculation is incorrect
- **Risk**: Buffer overflow
- **Fix**: Add bounds checking before array access

### ext/nnstreamer/tensor_filter/tensor_filter_python3.cc

**Bug #8: Python Object Reference Leak**
- **Location**: Lines 500-520 in `PYCore::setInputTensorDim()`
- **Issue**: If `PyTensorShape_New()` fails after some shapes are created, previously created Python objects are not decremented
- **Risk**: Python object memory leak
- **Fix**: Use cleanup loop for partial allocations

**Bug #9: Map Iterator Invalidation**
- **Location**: Lines 520-540 in `PYCore::freeOutputTensors()`
- **Issue**: The `outputArrayMap.erase(it)` call could invalidate iterator, but there's no subsequent protection against reuse
- **Risk**: Iterator invalidation crash
- **Fix**: Use safer erase pattern or ensure no further iterator use

**Bug #10: Incomplete Error Handling in Run Method**
- **Location**: Lines 570-620 in `PYCore::run()`
- **Issue**: If output array creation fails midway through the loop, previous arrays in the map are not cleaned up properly, leading to reference leaks
- **Risk**: Python object reference leaks
- **Fix**: Clean up partial results on failure

**Bug #11: Threading Issue with Python GIL**
- **Location**: Throughout the Python filter
- **Issue**: Multiple functions acquire/release GIL but if an exception occurs between lock/unlock, GIL state becomes inconsistent
- **Risk**: Deadlock or Python interpreter corruption
- **Fix**: Use RAII pattern for GIL management

### ext/nnstreamer/tensor_filter/tensor_filter_onnxruntime.cc

**Bug #12: Resource Leak in Error Path**
- **Location**: Lines 250-280 in `configure_instance()`
- **Issue**: If session creation succeeds but subsequent operations fail, ONNX runtime objects are not properly released
- **Risk**: Memory and resource leaks
- **Fix**: Implement proper cleanup in all error paths

**Bug #13: Missing Exception Safety**
- **Location**: Lines 350-380 in `invoke()`
- **Issue**: If `CreateTensor()` throws an exception after some tensors are created, there's no cleanup for partial tensor creation
- **Risk**: Resource leak on exception
- **Fix**: Use RAII or try-catch with cleanup

### ext/nnstreamer/tensor_filter/tensor_filter_tensorrt.cc

**Bug #14: CUDA Memory Leak in Error Path**
- **Location**: Lines 260-290 in `invoke()`
- **Issue**: If `cudaMallocManaged()` succeeds for output buffer but `execute()` fails, the allocated CUDA memory is not freed
- **Risk**: GPU memory leak
- **Fix**: Free CUDA memory on all error paths

**Bug #15: Missing CUDA Error Handling**
- **Location**: Lines 300-320 in `allocBuffer()`
- **Issue**: `cudaMallocManaged()` failure is checked, but other CUDA operations like `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` don't check for errors
- **Risk**: Silent CUDA failures
- **Fix**: Check all CUDA operation return values

**Bug #16: Resource Management in Destructor**
- **Location**: Lines 130-150 in `~tensorrt_subplugin()`
- **Issue**: If `cudaFree()` is called but CUDA context is already destroyed, it can cause undefined behavior
- **Risk**: Undefined behavior on cleanup
- **Fix**: Check CUDA context validity before operations

### ext/nnstreamer/tensor_filter/tensor_filter_movidius_ncsdk2.c

**Bug #17: Device Handle Leak on Failure**
- **Location**: Lines 140-170 in `_mvncsdk2_open()`
- **Issue**: When device creation succeeds but graph creation fails, some error paths don't call `ncDeviceDestroy()`
- **Risk**: Device handle leak
- **Fix**: Ensure device cleanup on all error paths

**Bug #18: FIFO Resource Imbalance**
- **Location**: Lines 240-270 in `_mvncsdk2_open()`
- **Issue**: If output FIFO allocation fails, input FIFO is destroyed but input FIFO handle isn't nullified, potentially causing double-free
- **Risk**: Double-free or use-after-free
- **Fix**: Nullify handles after destruction

**Bug #19: Error Handling in Invoke**
- **Location**: Lines 340-380 in `_mvncsdk2_invoke()`
- **Issue**: On inference failure, the function calls `_mvncsdk2_close()` which destroys all resources, but caller might still try to use them
- **Risk**: Use-after-free by caller
- **Fix**: Set appropriate error states instead of destroying resources

## Common Patterns and Critical Issues

### Memory Management
- **Resource cleanup in error paths**: Many filters fail to properly clean up resources when initialization fails partway through
- **Reference counting issues**: Python objects, shared models, and GPU resources often have incorrect reference counting

### Device/Hardware Resource Management  
- **GPU memory leaks**: CUDA and other GPU resources are not always freed on error paths
- **Device handle management**: Hardware devices (Movidius, TensorRT) have complex handle lifecycles with potential leaks

### Thread Safety
- **Shared resource access**: Multiple filters have race conditions when accessing shared resources
- **Python GIL management**: Inconsistent GIL acquisition/release patterns

### Error Handling
- **Partial initialization cleanup**: When initialization fails halfway through, partial results are often not cleaned up
- **Exception safety**: C++ filters don't always handle exceptions safely, leading to resource leaks

## Additional Notes

The tensor filter implementations handle complex resource management across multiple domains (CPU, GPU, NPU, Python runtime). The bugs identified represent significant stability and reliability issues that could cause:

- Memory exhaustion in long-running applications
- Deadlocks in multi-threaded environments  
- Device resource exhaustion
- Python interpreter corruption
- GPU memory exhaustion

These issues require systematic fixing with comprehensive testing across all supported hardware configurations.
